# Forecasting-NYC-Uber-Lyft-Trip-Demand
**A Time Series Analysis for Location-Based Demand Forecasting**
# NYC Uber/Lyft Trip Demand Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the demand for Uber and Lyft trips in different locations of New York City (NYC). The project utilizes historical trip data and applies time series analysis techniques to forecast the demand for each location every 15 minutes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of NYC Uber/Lyft trip records from January 2022 to March 2023. Each record includes information such as timestamp, location, and trip details. The dataset is preprocessed and divided into different locations based on the provided information.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Trained models saved for future use.
- `predictions/`: Predicted demand values for each location every 15 minutes.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and scripts used throughout the project.
